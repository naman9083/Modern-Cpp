Processor: It is a hardware device based on SILICON(ATLEAST TILL TODAY) which executed instructions given
           E.g Intel i7 12Gen-1265U

Core: It is a section of the processor which is cabable of executing one whole process

SINGLE THREAD, SINGLE PROCESS, SYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS!


Delays: IO Delay, CPU-BOUND Delay!


17 Questions:

1) What are we doing?
    - We are trying to do more work in our program per second
    - I want my efficiency in my program for which I want to my hardware better

2) How?
    - By using the OS for support. We are requesting OS to run inpendent sections of my program parallely if possible or cocurrently if nothing else works out!

3) Syntax wise what to do?
    - Each of your independent functions can be treated "logical threads". They can be scheduled by OS if your create a thread object and attach it to one callable with right paramters

    - Also remember to wait for threads to finish
    |   |   | OR
    DETACH FROM SPAWNED THREADS

4) Why did you join threads?
    - Because main thread cannot finish before other threads as spawned threads need to report need to report back to main via signals.
    If main is already finished, then thread has to become daemon.

    daemon is a thread running in background

5) What is std::thread?
    - It is a class which is a wrapper around a native platform specific OS-level thread.

6) Can we copy threads?
    - No, once mini-program is started, copying it would mean duplicating and doing the same thing again!


7) Can we make a container of thread?
    - Yes, since thread instances are objects, you can do this!

8) What is a race condition? 
    - 2 or more thread are fighting TO PERFORM A WRITE OPERATION ON A SHARED MEMORY

9) What is a critical section?
    - A part of a program where race-condition can happen to cause data integrity issue, in-coherenet output, or worse!

10) Syntantically, how to do this?
    - Choose between the plethora(too many) of available choice for sychronization primitived.
    - mutex: a binary semaphore which needs to locked/unlocked manually.
    - lock_gaurd: which is a scope based lock that uses RAII
    -unique_lock: It can be locked/unlocked manually as well as WITH RAII rules
    -condition variable : To implement sychronization based on PRODUCER/CONSUMER model

11)  How will I know which one to use?
    - Common sense!

12) How will I learn all this?
    - That's where Harshit comes into the picture
    - also, cppcon and cocurrency in action books are great resources!

13) All this sound like OS level stuff why I am learning it?
    - Because all developers need to use hardware efficiently

14) What is this SYNCHRONOUS/ASYNCHRONOUS stuff?
    - If you start command/instruction N only after COMMAND/ INSTRUCTION N-1 IS FULLY COMPLETED, execution is synchronous,

    else 
        ASYNCHRONOUS
    
15) Is async this same async I have learnt in JS/and/or other languages?
    - Yes, OF Course!

16) What if I Don't understand all this before the marathon?
    -WELL.............................
        - I heard TCS is still hiring!
