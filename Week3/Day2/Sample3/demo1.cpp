    Producer consumer problem!
    2 workers in your program

        the other will "consume it"(process the produced item)

    2 Threads (2 workers)
        - main thread(producer): take input and "make value available"

        - operation(t1)[consumer]: Once signal is received from the main to indicate "input" value  received,     calculate the square

            a)Programmers calculates how many workers are required  and trigeers them at a time [thread pooling]

            b)t1 may want to do some other works even before data input is received
