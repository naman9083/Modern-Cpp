1) The concept of relating/binding member    |1) Hiding the internal implementation of the object
   functions with data member                |   from any party/entity/line of code outside the 
                                             |   class. You can use data binding to achieve 
2)                                           |   Encapsulation providing functions as layer between

Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a behiaviour(functions) so that:
a) It allows programmers to reimplement a functionality in a different way down the class hierarchy by overriding in child classes.

b) By using Abstraction we can talk in "ABSTRACT" terns while explaining behiaviour.



Find the details of an account based on ID, calculate, min, max, total or print details of cheque based on cheque number, etc.




Standard Pattern for Solving problem

1) Read the problem statement completely twice at least before doing anything!
2) Compile program only when it is fully completed.
3) Always work on individula functions only, Breakdown entire solution into small-small sections!
4) Always draw a diagram
5) Spend more time in designing the solution for each functionality rather than implementating it.    





Vitual Keyword Usage:

Scenario 1: I want to model some data. Bind members when accessible and Perform basic functions 
   - Create a simple class.
   - Bind data members with member functions. Keep all data private.



Scenario 2: I want to create types abd sub-types so that I can generalize operalizes or implement specific solutions for specific sub-categories
   Then, ask the following questions:
      a) Are all method implemented in all classes?
            - if yes, no need for pure virtual functions
      b) Are we going tp create objects of multiple child classes and store them together in the same container?
         - if yes, we need to use upcasting.
         - Base class mehods must be marked as virtual.
         - Destrcutor must be marked as virtual

      c) Do we need to make the base class abstract/ Do we need to prevent to instatiation (object creation for base class?)

      d) I'm not very sure if method will be overriden. Maybe in future Not sure currently
         - Mark all such mehod as virtual
Rule 1:
   For a class that contains at least 1 virtual method 
   A virtual table is created in memory.
   This table has addresses for the virtual methods functions 

Rule 2:
   If a class inherits from a parent class that also contains a VTable, the child will also implementits own VTable

A* ptr = new B();


ptr->Display();// B Display;
ptr->Test();// A Test;


//step 1: verify where is display function
   - Go to class whose type is ptr's type
   - Go to A class. Verify whether this function is atleast declared in class A

//step 2: Verify if the method is non-virtual. If yes, call the function
            -if the function is virtual proceed to step 3:

//step 3: Now find the type of RHS(Object type).Find the VTable for the object and call function based on Entry IN VTABLE
Dynamic Method Dispatch:


      class A{
         ....
         ....
         static //hidden member *vptr;
         public:
            virtual void display(){
               std::Cout<< "A display\n";
            }
            void Test(){
               std::cout<<"A class test method\n";
            }
      };
      class B{

         ....
         ....
         public: 
         virtual void Display() ovverride {
            std::cout<<"B's Dispatch\n";
            
         }

         void Test(){
            std:: cout<<"B test called\n"; 
         }
      }





VTable:

For a class that contains atleast one virtual method a virtual table is created in memory
This table has addresses for the virtual methods functions.


Class A VTable
[A :: Display():: 0x 10045H]

0x777H
   ^
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
[vptr]

Class B VTable
[B :: Display():: 0x 10045H]

0x777H
   ^
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
[vptr]
