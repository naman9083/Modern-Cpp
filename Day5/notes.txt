Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a behiaviour(functions) so that:
a) It allows programmers to reimplement a functionality in a different way down the class hierarchy by overriding in child classes.

b) By using Abstraction we can talk in "ABSTRACT" terns while explaining behiaviour.
