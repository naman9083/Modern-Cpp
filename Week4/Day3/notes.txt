A situation where only one element needs to be accessed and it is the most recent item inserted in the container

e.g. : A compiler executing functions calls
f1()
{
    f2();
}

call stack :

    f2 < -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -recently added,
    top most entry.Will be accessed first !

        f1 < -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -still pending

                                  for (int i = 0; i < row; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
    {
        std::cout << i * j << "\n";
    }
}
Linear Search

Operation : Access iten and compare
N : Size of elements to be checked

TIme complexity : O(n)

Time complexity is NOT MEASURED IN UNITS OF TIME !!!

Time complexity is always concerned about "How many Operations" per input elements !

Step1: Always find relation between N(number of input items) and operation where "operation" is context specific.

e.g: In linear search, operation is "access element and compare"
     In binary search, check middle, if found, okay, else divide
